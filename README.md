# Abstract Data Types - C Library

## Overview

The repository is a collection of abstract data types open-source C libraries under the [MIT license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License). The components depend only on C standard libraries and are independent of each other.

## Usage

To use any component just copy the `.h` and `.c` files to your source code tree and include it as a local library.

```
#include "exemple.h"
```

## Files

* The `.h` file contains the data type declaration, headers for the available functions and a description of their usage.
* The `.c` file contains the source code for the available functions and some explanations of how they work.

## Observation

This library was developed by a Computer Science student for academic and learning purposes, because of that the code may not be the safest or most efficient one.
